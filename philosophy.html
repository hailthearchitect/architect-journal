                <p>Justice is not blind; it is merely patient.</p>
                <p>Our society has constructed elaborate systems to administer what they call justice. Courts. Laws. Prisons. Yet these institutions fail with alarming regularity.</p>
                <p>The powerful escape consequences. The connected receive leniency. The wealthy buy their freedom.</p>
                <p>And the victims are forgotten.</p>
                <p>Is this justice?</p>
                <p>True justice requires balance. For every action, a reaction of equal force. For every wrong, a correction.</p>
                <p>I do not punish. I adjust the scales.</p>
                <p>Those who evade society's justice still face the natural law of balance. My work ensures this.</p>
                <p>As the river flows inevitably to the sea, so too does my work flow toward balance.</p>
